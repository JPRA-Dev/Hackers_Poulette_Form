# Hackers_Poulette_Form



## General informations 
Title       : Hackers Poulette "Contact Support From"  
Description : The company Hackers Poulette ™ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own. They want to allow their users to contact their support team. My mission was to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP.
It had to display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).
