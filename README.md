## Functionalities
The form should be comprised of:
- Name and lastname
- Gender
- Email address
- Country
- Subject (3 possibilities)
- Message

Must have:
- the form's html code must be semantically valid
- the HTML must be accessible to blind people
- in case of wrong input, the form should display a useful visual clue about the error
- display the error message near the correct input field
- the error message must be readable (helpful to users)
- the form has to be sanitised and validated (server side)
- if all required inputs are valid, the script should respond by email to a given address (it doesn't because I did remove the main email that I was using after)
